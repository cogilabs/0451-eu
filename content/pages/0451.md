## Origins

## Cultural Impact
The code has become a trademark of immersive sims and games that emphasize player choice. It serves as both a tribute to the genre's roots and a way for developers to acknowledge their gaming lineage. Modern games continue to include it as an homage to Looking Glass Studios and the immersive sim genre.

## Fun Facts
- Named after Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury
